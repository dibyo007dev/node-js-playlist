HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes: informational responses, successful responses, redirects, client errors, and servers errors.

Information responses
100 Continue
This interim response indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue with the request or ignore it if it is already finished.
101 Switching Protocol
This code is sent in response to an Upgrade: request header by the client, and indicates that the protocol the server is switching too. It was introduced to allow migration to an incompatible protocol version, and is not in common use.
Successful responses
200 OK
The request has succeeded. The meaning oGET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.
POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server
201 Created
The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result of it. This is typically the response sent after a PUT request.
202 Accepted
The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is non-committal, meaning that there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of processing the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.
203 Non-Authoritative Information
This response code means returned meta-information set is no

204 No Content
There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful. The user-agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.
205 Reset Content
This response code is sent after accomplishing request to tell user agent reset document view which sent this request.
206 Partial Content
This response code is used because of range header sent by the client to separate download into multiple streams.
Redirection messages
300 Multiple Choice
The request has more than one possible responses. User-agent or user should choose one of them. There is no standardized way to choose one of the responses.
301 Moved Permanently
This response code means that URI of requested resource has been changed. Probably, new URI would be given in the response.
302 Found
This response code means that URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily. New changes in the URI might be made in the future. Therefore, this same URI should be used by the client in future requests.

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes: informational responses, successful responses, redirects, client errors, and servers errors.

Information responses
100 Continue
This interim response indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue with the request or ignore it if it is already finished.
101 Switching Protocol
This code is sent in response to an Upgrade: request header by the client, and indicates that the protocol the server is switching too. It was introduced to allow migration to an incompatible protocol version, and is not in common use.
Successful responses
200 OK
The request has succeeded. The meaning oGET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.
POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server
201 Created
The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result of it. This is typically the response sent after a PUT request.
202 Accepted
The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is non-committal, meaning that there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of processing the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes: informational responses, successful responses, redirects, client errors, and servers errors.

Information responses
100 Continue
This interim response indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue with the request or ignore it if it is already finished.
101 Switching Protocol
This code is sent in response to an Upgrade: request header by the client, and indicates that the protocol the server is switching too. It was introduced to allow migration to an incompatible protocol version, and is not in common use.
Successful responses
200 OK
The request has succeeded. The meaning oGET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.
POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server
201 Created
The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result of it. This is typically the response sent after a PUT request.
202 Accepted
The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is non-committal, meaning that there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of processing the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.
203 Non-Authoritative Information
This response code means returned meta-information set is no

204 No Content
There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful. The user-agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.
205 Reset Content
This response code is sent after accomplishing request to tell user agent reset document view which sent this request.
206 Partial Content
This response code is used because of range header sent by the client to separate download into multiple streams.
Redirection messages
300 Multiple Choice
The request has more than one possible responses. User-agent or user should choose one of them. There is no standardized way to choose one of the responses.
301 Moved Permanently
This response code means that URI of requested resource has been changed. Probably, new URI would be given in the response.
302 Found
This response code means that URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily. New changes in the URI might be made in the future. Therefore, this same URI should be used by the client in future requests.
